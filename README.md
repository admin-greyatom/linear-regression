# linear-regression
This is a sample concept to see how the content created at GreyAtom looks like. Currently for the data science programs, we are building the content in jupyter notebooks. This repository contains the sample notebook that is built before it is deployed in GLabs.

This repository gives you an idea of how the end content that you are about to build looks like. Before you start building out the content, you have to first build out a content tree. This is how the content tree for linear regression looks like -> [Content Tree of Linear Regression](https://github.com/admin-greyatom/linear-regression/blob/master/content_tree.md).

Once you have built the content tree and the storyboarding of how the content would look like, you will have to start building the content for the learners. The end state of the content post build would be something like this -> [Linear Regression Notebook](https://github.com/admin-greyatom/linear-regression/blob/master/notebooks/notebook.ipynb). 

You have already submitted the sample templates, so you can use the same templates for building out the learning content as well as the project. Along with these, you also have to build out a quiz to test the conceptual understanding of the learners. A quiz for linear regression is provided to you for reference -> [Linear Regression Quiz](https://github.com/admin-greyatom/linear-regression/blob/master/linear_regression_quiz.ipynb).
